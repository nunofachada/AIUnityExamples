# Bayes Monsters

## Summary

A simple game in which the player needs to defend itself against two enemy
types, demons, and dragons, which can attack at different speeds. The proper
defense, either a sword or a bow and arrow, depends on both the type of enemy
and its speed. After a few games, the human player becomes proficient and is
able to obtain better scores. However, the moves of the human player are used to
train a naive Bayes classifier, which, after a few rounds of observations, can
play the game by itselfâ€”at a similar proficiency to the human that played
before.
