# SimpleNavMesh

## Summary

This prototype is implemented with Unityâ€™s [Navigation and Pathfinding] system,
in which an agent moves to a destination in a 3D space filled with obstacles
(walls) and enemies moving between waypoints. When the agent reaches its
destination, a new destination appears from a round-robin list of waypoints.
Students can place enemies, modify their waypoints, or change the list of agent
destination waypoints, as well as its dynamic movement properties.

## Supporting code and assets
